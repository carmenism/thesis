What is the effect on herring?,Decreased a little,3
Why?,"By doubling the harvesting effort of pelagics, herring which are pelagics decreased a little.",
What is the effect on winter flounder?,Increased a lot,3
Why?,"By decreasing the harvesting of flatfish, Winter flounder populations increased a lot being themselves flatfish",
What is the effect on yellowtail flounder?,Stayed about the same,3
Why?,"As another species of flatfish, the yellow tail flounder populations remained about the same due to decreasing harvesting of flatfish by half. This may be that yellowtail flounder are not commerically sought after.",
What is the effect on skates?,Decreased a lot,3
Why?,"By doubling harvesting efforts of elasmobranch, skates populations decreased a lot.",
What is the effect on cod?,Increased a little,1
Why?,"Because harvest efforts for elasmobranchs was double. The main predator of cod, the spiny dogfish was decreased and as a result, cod populations increased a little.",
What is the effect on haddock?,Decreased a little,2
Why?,"By doubling harvesting efforst on the elasmobranchs, cod populations have flourished due to there being less spiny dogfish to eat them. This in turn has caused haddock populations to decrease a little because haddock compete. with cod for prey.",
What is the effect on windowpane?,Decreased a lot,3
Why?,"By increasing harvesting efforts of elasmobranchs, the spiny dogfish population ( a elasmobranch) has decreased, this has allowed cod populations to increased because spiny dogfish prey on cod and since cod compete a little with windowpane, windowpane population has decreased a little. Also contributing to this, spiny dogfish and skates compete for food with winter and yellowtail flounder and thus without the competition, those populations have increased. Both flounder also compete with windowpane for food and have caused that population to decrease a little.",
