What is the effect on herring?,Decreased a little,3
Why?,It decreased because the increase of harvest effort on the small pelogies.,
What is the effect on winter flounder?,Increased a lot,3
Why?,Increased because of the decreased harvest effort of flatfish. Decreasing that effort also increased yellowtail population slightly giving winter flounder more yellowtail to eat increasing their population even more. ,
What is the effect on yellowtail flounder?,Increased a little,2
Why?,The harvest effort was decreased obviously allowing more fish in the population. The winter flounder and windowpane had a decreased harvest effort therefore larger populations and they're all predators of yellowtail so they were eating them which is why the yellowtail had such a small increase. ,
What is the effect on skates?,Decreased a lot,3
Why?,"The harvest effect increased so obviously there would be less fish. Skates also has a lot of competition with windowpane, winter flounder, and yellowtail flounder. ",
What is the effect on cod?,Increased a lot,3
Why?,Cod's largest predator is the Spiny Dogfish. The increased harvest effort of elasmobranches decreases the populations of Spiny Dogfish therefore causing less poroblems of being consumed amongst the cod. ,
What is the effect on haddock?,Decreased a little,2
Why?,"Haddock has more competition with other fish that would've otherwise been eaten by the spiny dogfish or skates. Since these fish aren't being eaten as much, there are more to compete against the haddock making their lives harder. ",
What is the effect on windowpane?,Decreased a little,1
Why?,They decreased because competition with other fish increased. ,
