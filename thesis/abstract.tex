Fishery management is the science of setting rules for governing fishing so that it is done in a sustainable manner, with the hope that future generations can also make use of the fisheries.  An ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM) approach has been advocated to recognize ecosystems as the complex systems that they are.  If EBFM is to be put into effect, then fishery managers require ecological models which take many factors into account. MS-PROD is one such model; it is a multi-species production model which forecasts the biomass of ten species of fish in the Gulf of Maine over 30 years.  In the model, the biomass of each fish species depends on effects from harvesting and interactions with the other fish species.  We have designed and implemented an interactive interface to the model that allows the user to investigate the impact of changes in fishing effort in real time.  By combining time series with a network representation, our visualization shows the predicted biomasses of the fish, the changes in biomass that can result from changes in fishing effort, the causal relationships that help to explain the effects of changes in fishing effort, and the uncertainty of the model.  We have conducted an evaluation to compare different depictions of the causal relationships in the model---predation and competition---which found that representing those relationships with arc diagrams enhanced understanding of the model.  Our visualization is a novel combination of features which we hope will be a powerful tool to help fishery managers make informed decisions.
