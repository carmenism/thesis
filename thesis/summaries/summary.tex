\section{Analyzing the tradeoffs among ecological and fishing effects on an example fish community: A multispecies (fisheries) production model}

A multispecies fisheries production model (MS-PROD) \cite{Gamble20092570} incorporates ecological interactions such as predation and competition.  It is distinguished from similiar models by considering competition both within and between groups.  The model itself is a series of differential equations based on the Schaefer production model and takes into account Lotka-Volterra terms for interactions as well as carrying capacities for both the entire system and each group.  The purpose of the model is to evaluate whether or not the modeled ecosystem can support biomass at maximum sustainable yield ($B_{MSY}$).  Simulations done with MS-PROD have implied that it may be impossible for the species in some ecosystems to all be at $B_{MSY}$ at once.  These simulations also emphasized the significance of incoporating predation and competition into production models by showing that these interactions account for a non-trivial amount of the biomass loss.
