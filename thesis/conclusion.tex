\chapter{Conclusion}

A long-term goal of this thesis has been to help the fishery management community make informed decisions with the use the MS-PROD model through our interface.  Declaring whether we achieved this long-term goal depends on public unveiling of the MS-PROD model by its original authors and time to determine if it actually benefits managers, fishermen, and other significant stakeholders.  On the other hand, the short-term goal of this thesis has been develop an interactive visualization which would enhance understanding of a complicated, multi-species production model, MS-PROD.  More specifically, we investigated the effectiveness of different methods for depicting causal relationships.  To measure this objectively, we conducted an evaluation of the different depictions of the predation and competition relationships between the ten key species of the MS-PROD model.
