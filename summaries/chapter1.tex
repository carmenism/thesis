Fishery managers have only one ``lever'' to pull when it comes to fishery management: the ability to set harvest quotas.  Fishermen work within these quotas by exerting various levels of fishing effort.  Both managers and fisherman can better understand the ecosystem they work within and the implications of their decisions with the assistance of a production model, which is a system of differential equations designed to predict outcomes.  A visualization enhances such a model by making its inner workings more explicit. We hope to show that our visualization of the MS-PROD model is valuable tool to the modellers and stakeholders alike.
