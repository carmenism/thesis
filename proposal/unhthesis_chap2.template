\chapter{My Second Chapter Title}

    Remember that, when entering text for your document, you tell LaTeX to
    start a new paragraph by simply inserting a blank line.  Also remember
    that it makes no difference     how      many        spaces      you
    put                   between            words.  One is as good as a
    hundred.

    Do you have a copy of the LaTeX manual~\cite{The-Manual} yet?    You
    {\em will\/} need it.  LaTeX is easy to use and for simple  documents,
    you could probably go a long ways without having to look at the manual. 
    But a thesis or dissertation is not a simple document.  Save yourself
    some grief and get a copy of the manual and start reading it now.
