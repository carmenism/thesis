\section{User Evaluation}

The user evaluation will be conducted in the manner of a semi-structured interview.  Users will be instructed on the various features of the MS-PROD visualization, then asked to either rate or rank the different features.  Some questions which may be included are:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Which visualization method did you like the best?
  \item How useful did you find this feature?
  \item How well do you think you have understood the model?
\end{itemize}
