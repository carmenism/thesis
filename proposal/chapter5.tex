\chapter{Work to be Completed}

The remaining work consists of completing a user evaluation and then creating a finalized user interface for the MS-PROD model by selecting from the different visualization alternatives according to the evaluation results.  When finalized, our user interface for the MS-PROD model should achieve its goal of being an effective tool for models and other stakeholders to use to evaluate fishery quota decisions.

\section{User Evaluation}

There will be two phases to the user evaluation.  First, experts will be instructed on how to use the MS-PROD visualization and questioned about their preferences in the form of a semi-structured interview.  Second, novice users will be evaluated on their understanding of the model.

\subsection{Experts}

For the expert evaluation, we will visit the authors of the MS-PROD model, scientists, fishery managers, and other significant stakeholders.  First, we will instruct them on how to use the various visualization alternatives.  Then, we will ask them about their preferences and opinions regarding the two views (four panel grid and small multiples), the three methods for displaying change (none, line, and blend), and the four types of uncertainty (multi-line, box plots, error bars, and error bands).  The different features will be either ranked or rated.  Some questions which may be asked are:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Which visualization method did you like the best?
  \item Is this feature useful?
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Novices}

The second evaluation will be geared toward novice users---i.e., undergraduate and/or graduate students.  Participants will be instructed in how to use the user interface to the model.  Next, participants will be asked questions to guage their understanding of the model.  For example, the participant may asked questions like, ``What happens to X if we increase catch on Y?''  More importantly, this question will be followed up with the question of ``Why?''  The goal will be to determine whether or not average users can gain an understanding of the complex relationships that result in indirect and chained effects.
