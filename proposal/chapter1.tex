Fishery managers have only one ``lever'' to pull when it comes to fishery management: the ability to set harvest quotas.  Fishermen work within these quotas by exerting various levels of fishing effort.  Both managers and fisherman can better understand the ecosystem they work within and the implications of their decisions with the assistance of a production model.  In this context, a production model is a mathematical model, based on data, that simulates interactions between species and predicts species biomass as a function of fishing effort, climate change, and other variables.  MS-PROD is a multispecies production model developed by NOAA scientists Gamble and Link \cite{gamble2009}.  A visualization may enhance such a model by making its inner workings more explicit and may be useful for decision making. The goal of the proposed research is to explore design alternatives and evaluate the effectiveness of different modes of portrayal and interaction to make a visualization of the MS-PROD model that will be a valuable tool to the modelers and stakeholders alike.
